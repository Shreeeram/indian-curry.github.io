Indian curry is a informal group of functional programmers/enthusiasts
loosely based in India. One of the aims of this website is to connect
the dispersed functional programming community of India by bringing to
you the latest of the happenings in the Indian Functional programming
community.

We are organised on github at <https://github.com/indian-curry>. If
you run a regular meetup, hackthon or are planning to organise a
conference, you can update this page by sending us a pull request.
