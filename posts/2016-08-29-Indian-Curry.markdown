title: Indian Curry: Functional programming served red hot.
---

Indian Curry is informal group of functional programming enthusiasts
loosely based in India. In the global software world, India is already
a big player. We believe that if the industry has to move forward in
terms of building large and reliable software, functional programming
and related formal methods have to be adopted in a large scale.  The
goal is to accelerate this process.
