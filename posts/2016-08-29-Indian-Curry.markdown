title: "Indian Curry: Functional programming served red hot."
---

Indian Curry is an informal group of functional programming
enthusiasts loosely based in India. We believe there is a lot of
potential in the growth of functional programming in both the industry
and in the academic institutions of India. Currently, we only have a
few isolated individuals or small groups that are scattered around the
country. One of the goals of this group is to provide a common
platform for collaboration between these various groups.

The time has come for functional programming and related formal
methods to be adopted in a large scale. We hope to be a catalyst in
this process.
