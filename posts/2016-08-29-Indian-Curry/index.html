<p>Indian Curry is an informal group of functional programming enthusiasts loosely based in India. We believe there is a lot of potential in the growth of functional programming in both the industry and in the academic institutions of India. Currently, we only have a few isolated individuals or small groups that are scattered around the country. One of the goals of this group is to provide a common platform for collaboration between these various groups.</p>
<p>The time has come for functional programming and related formal methods to be adopted in a large scale. We hope to be a catalyst in this process.</p>
